## Registering Your Nickname

It is highly recommended that you register your nickname on the EsperNet IRC network. 
This helps prevent another user from joining the channel and using your nickname to impersonate you. 
To do this, simply use your desired nickname (/nick [nicknameyouwant]) and then type 
/msg nickserv REGISTER [password] [email-address]. Once you have successfully registered your nickname, 
no other user will be able to use your nickname unless they know your password. 
To identify yourself on IRC once you have registered your nickname, type /msg nickserv IDENTIFY [yourpassword].
