# Global Guidelines

The guidelines and information below applies to the entire forum.


## Do

* __Be Nice And Polite__

    Every member deserves to be treated with respect. Positive and polite posts create a friendly and welcoming environment that all members will feel comfortable in.

* __Post in English__

   While the site caters to an international audience, the primary language of the forum is English. Discussions topic should always be in English. Topics which offer content (such as maps, mods, or servers), may posted in their respective language.

* __Think Before Posting__

    Sensible, well thought-out and legible posts help other members understand what is being explained.

* __Search__

    Most questions have been asked before, searching for an answer to a question before posting gets that question answered faster and keeps duplicate content low.


* __Report Content__

    Reported content is sent to staff members for review. If a post needs to be removed or modified then reporting will make that happen.

* __Post in Relevant Section(s)__

    Posting in the most relevant section will ensure topics are seen by members most interested in the subject. Topics posted in the wrong section will generally be moved by moderators.

* __Remain on Topic__

    Topics should remain on the topic that they are discussing, they should not be discussing other topics. A new topic should be made for a new discussion.


## Do Not

* __Use Profanity__

    As a family friendly forum we censor all profanity, however the censor is not an excuse to still swear; all posts that contain any instance of profanity will be removed. This includes abbreviated curse words, profanity within acronyms, and profanity within pictures. Self-censoring is also not allowed

* __Bump Topics__

    Posting in a topic only to bring it back to the front page of the forum is not allowed, a topic should only be on the front page of a forum if there is active discussion taking place.

* __Spam__

    A spam post is a post that provides no value to the discussion. The most common spam posts are posting "tl:dr;", "+1", "this", posting image macros, and nothing but memes or images. These sort of posts really rustle our jimmies.

* __Post Duplicate Topics__

    Posting duplicate topics around the forum is considered spam. If a topic already exists, please use that topic instead of making a new one.

* __Reply to Inappropriate Content__

    If inappropriate content is posted the report feature should be used, replying to inappropriate content escalates the issue and can result in all involved parties receiving infractions.

* __Trade or Sell Minecraft Accounts__

    We do not allow the sale of Minecraft accounts. Minecraft accounts may be created and purchased through [Minecraft.net](http://minecraft.net). The sale of Minecraft cape codes (eg: [Minecon 2012 Capes](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/MineCon#Cape_2)) and any other game content is also disallowed.

* __Offer or Request Services/Products__

    With the exception of the [Minecraft Server Hosting](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forum/131-minecraft-server-hosting/) section and the [Shops and Requests](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forum/261-shops-and-requests/) section, we do not allow members to trade or sell services/products. Forums are for discussions, they are not a market or trading place.

* __Crowdsource__

    Requesting donations to fund a project that doesn't exist is not allowed. This includes but is not limited to: donations to start a server, donations to fund a giveaway, donations to start a mod/resource pack, etc.

* __Post Giveaways__

    Member-run giveaways or contests that require performing a specific action for entry (eg: 'subscribe to my Youtube channel', 'follow me on Twitter') are not allowed.

* __Beg for Donations__

    Posts which are primarily geared towards collecting donations are not allowed. Similarly, donation buttons within signatures are also forbidden. Donation information as a side note in a post is permitted, as long as it is relevant to the topic, however it should not be the main focus of the post.

* __Advertise__

    Advertising a non-commercial website in a signature is acceptable, however creating topics about a website is not allowed. To advertise on minecraftforum.net please contact the [Curse advertising department](http://www.curse.com/advertising/overview).

* __Misuse Money Linking Services__

    Sites that provide incentives for generating clickthroughs (such as adf.ly) are only allowed to be used for downloads of content that you created. We report any abuse to the site operators and will often result in the relevant accounts being shut down.

* __Hoax__

    Deliberately posting misleading or inaccurate information to confuse members is unacceptable. This includes sightings of Herobrine.

* __Access Accounts Without Permission__

    The only member permitted to access an account is the owner, unless permission is explicitly granted by that member.

* __Troll__

    Trolling of any kind is not tolerated. Accusing someone of trolling, which is known as "Troll Calling" is also disallowed, eg: "Stop trolling", "You're a troll!". If someone is trolling then it should be reported.

* __Flame or Provoke__

    Do not insult or flame other members of the forum. Similarly, do not post with the intention of provoking a reaction from fellow members. This includes encouraging flame wars. Instigation is not tolerated.

* __Grammar Harass__

    Please do not correct or insult other members grammar/spelling. Grammar harassment does not add to the discussion, and is not tolerated.

* __Use Referral/Affiliate Links__

    Posting incentive based links which reward users with cash, credit, or prizes in return for sales or click-throughs are not allowed. Monetary links such as Adf.ly are an exception to this rule, however must follow the ToS of both the monetary link service and any other rules specified.

* __Necro Post__

    Please do not reply to extremely old topics. Posts which continue substantial discussion of the topic are permitted. Contentless bumps which add very little to the discussion will be removed.

* __Post Provocative/Offensive Material__

    Provocative and/or offensive material of a sexual, violent or otherwise inappropriate nature is strictly not allowed. Please consider the types of content posted to a family friendly forum. Always ensure content is both "Safe For Work" and suitable for children.

* __Breach Privacy__

    Posting other peoples private information is not tolerated. Private information includes but is not limited to: real names, family names, photographs, email addresses, telephone numbers, Skype details, physical addresses.

### Illegal Activity

* __Redistribution of Mojang Property__

    Minecraft and all associated assets are property of Mojang. Redistribution of Mojang owned property (i.e. Minecraft.jar) is not allowed, all posts must remain inline with the [Minecraft Terms Of Service](http://www.minecraft.net/terms). Linking to Mojang hosted files is acceptable, eg: resources.minecraft.net.

    As a family friendly and all inclusive community we do not allow any form of discrimination, this includes -- but is not limited to -- age, race, gender, nationality, ethnicity, religion, sexuality and disability.

* __Spread Malicious Content__

    Viruses and malware in any form are forbidden, any intentional distribution of either will result in permanent removal from minecraftforum.net.


## Section Specific Rules

Each section (and individual forum) may have individual rules. Sectional rules rarely supercede the global rules however they may require your posts to be in made in a specific way or contain information not required in other sections. In the event multiple rules conflict, the rule which is most relevant to that section will be applied.


## Moderator Action

The following information is about what to do when you find people breaking the rules and what happens if you break the rules outlined above.


### Reporting a Post

Rule breaking posts should be reported by any member that comes across them. There is a "report" button on every post. When a post is reported, the moderators of the site are alerted. Reports automatically include the post content so there is no need to copy the post into the report. Reports should contain an explanation of why a post is being reported and any relevent information to help speed up processing.

Any content that needs moderator attention should be reported. There are no penalties for mis-reporting content, however abusing the report system is not allowed.


### Mini Modding

Mini-modding is replying to a rule breaking post with information on the rule break. Some forms of mini-modding are allowed: If a member has broken a section specific rule (such as posting in the wrong section or not including required information) members are allowed to reply to the member explaining what rule has been broken and how to fix the issue. To be acceptable "mini-modding" the post must meet the following requirements:

* Explains which rule the post breaks
* Explains (where necessary) how the poster can rectify the issue
* Does not make statements such as: "reported", "I've told the mods", "This will be locked now" etc.
* The post must be reported

"Mini-modding" type posts will be removed once a moderator has dealt with the topic/post in question.


## Infractions

When a rule is broken an infraction will be issued. There are 2 types of infractions: formal and informal


### Informal

An informal infraction is used to remind a member that they have broken the rules for the first time. Informal infractions are used as a record of when a member has been informed, and as such, do not carry any penalities. There are no infraction points issued with informals so they do not count to the posting suspension limits.


### Formal

A formal infraction is issued when a rule has been broken and we believe continued violation of this rule should result in a posting suspension. A formal infraction can have between 1 and 10 points associated with it with the average formal infraction having 1 point. Rule violations which are illegal or not 
tolerated are always issued a formal infraction.


### Points

30 days after an infraction is issued, it is expired and the current total of a member's points is reduced by the number the expired infraction added.

When a member's total infraction points reaches 2 or higher from an infraction, then posting suspensions are issued based on the points the infraction issued.

* 1 point infractions will give a 3 day suspension
* 2 point infractions will give a 6 day suspension
* 3 point infractions will give a 9 day suspension

Suspension times may be changed at the discretion of the administration.


### Permanent Bans

Permanent bans are not automatically issued, they are reserved for members that we believe to be detrimental to the minecraftforum.net community. They are issued to members that continually break the rules and do not provide any value to the community.


## Disclaimer

The administrators and moderators are responsible for the smooth and efficient running of the site. The staff reserves the right to take whatever action is deemed appropriate in any given situation, regardless of whether there is a specific rule covering that situation or not. If there is a misunderstanding or dispute, then please bring the issue up politely with that staff member or their administrator in private. In all matters, the decision of the administration is final.
