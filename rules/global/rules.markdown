# Global Guidelines

The guidelines and information below applies to the entire forum.

## Do

* __Be Nice And Polite__

    Every member deserves to be treated with respect. Positive and polite posts 
    create a friendly and welcoming environment that all members will feel 
    comfortable in.

* __Search__

    Most questions have been asked before, searching for an answer to a question 
    before posting gets a question answered faster and keeps duplicate content 
    low.

* __Think Before Posting__

    Sensible, well thought-out and legible posts help other members understand
    what you are trying to explain.

* __Report Content__
    
    Reported content is sent to staff members for review, if a post needs to be 
    removed or modified then reporting will make that happen.

* __Post In Relevant Section(s)__

    Posting in the most relevant section will ensure topics are seen by members
    most interested in the subject. Topics posted in the wrong section will be
    moved by moderators.
    
* __Remain on topic__

    Topics should remain on the topic that they are discussing, they should not be 
    discussing other topics. A new topic should be made for a new discussion.
    
* __Embed images__

    When posting a topic which requires embedded images or videos by the section specific rules, embed them. Do not        use data:image links, as they only look messy and take up a lot of space. A tutorial on how to embed images can be      found [here](http://img.mcf.li/images.jpg), and a tutorial about embedding videos can be found [here](http://img.mcf.li/video_guide.png).
    
* __Post in English__

   While the site caters to an international audience, the primary language of the forum is English. When creating a new thread or post, please be courteous and _at least_ include an English translation of your post.


## Do Not

* __Use Profanity__

    As a family friendly forum we censor all profanity, however the censor is
    not an excuse to still swear; all posts that contain any instance of 
    profanity will be removed. This includes abbreviated curse words, profanity
    within acronyms, and profanity within pictures. Self-censoring is also not allowed.

* __Bump Threads__
    
    Posting in a topic only to bring it back to the front page of the forum
    is not allowed, a topic should only be on the front page of a forum if there
    is active discussion taking place.

* __Spam__

    A spam post is a post that provides no value to the discussion. The most 
    common spam posts are posting "tl:dr;", "+1", "this", posting image macros,
    and nothing but memes or images. These sort of posts really rustle our jimmies.
    
* __Post Duplicate Threads__

    Posting duplicate topics around the forum is considered spam. There is no need
    to clutter the forum by posting multiple instances of the same thread.

* __Reply to Inappropriate Content__

    If inappropriate content is posted the report feature should be used,
    replying to inappropriate content escalates the issue and can result in all
    involved parties receiving infractions.

* __Trade or Sell Minecraft Accounts__
    
    We do not allow the sale of Minecraft Accounts, if you wish to acquire a
    Minecraft account please purchase via [Minecraft.net](http://minecraft.net).
    The sale of Minecraft Cape codes (eg: <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/MineCon#Cape_2">Minecon 2012 Cape</a>) 
    and any other game content is also disallowed.

* __Offer or Request Services/Products__
    
    With the exception of the
    [Minecraft Server Hosting](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forum/131-minecraft-server-hosting/)
    section and the
    [Shops and Requests](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forum/261-shops-and-requests/)
    section, we do not allow members to trade or sell services/products.
    Forums are for discussions, they are not a market or trading place.

* __Crowdsource__

    Requesting donations to fund a project that doesn't exist is not allowed on the forums.
    This includes but is not limited to: Donations to start a server, donations to fund
    a giveaway, donations to start a mod/resource pack, etc.

* __Post Giveaways__

    Member-run giveaways or contests that require performing a specific action
    for entry (eg: subscribe to my Youtube channel, follow me on Twitter) 
    are not allowed.
    
* __Beg for Donations__

    Posts which are primarily geared towards collecting donations are not allowed. 
    Similarly, donation buttons within signatures are also forbidden. You may 
    include donation information as a side note in your thread however it
    should not be the main focus of your post.

* __Advertise__

    Advertising a non-commercial website in your signature is acceptable, however creating
    topics about your website is not allowed. If you want to advertise on
    minecraftforum.net please contact the 
    [Curse advertising department](http://www.curse.com/advertising/overview).

* __Misuse Money Linking Services__

    Sites that provide incentives for generating clickthroughs (such as adf.ly)
    are only allowed to be used for downloads of content that you created. We
    report any abuse to the site operators and will often result in the
    relevant accounts being shut down.

* __Hoax__

    Deliberately posting misleading or inaccurate information to confuse members
    is unacceptable. This includes sightings of Herobrine.

* __Access Accounts Without Permission__

    The only member permitted to access an account is the owner, unless permission
    is explicitly granted by that member.

* __Troll__

    Trolling of any kind is not tolerated.
    Accusing someone of trolling, which is known as "Troll Calling" is also disallowed,
    eg: "Stop trolling", "You're a troll!". If someone is trolling they should be 
    reported.
    
* __Flame or Provoke__

    Do not insult or flame other members of the forum. Similarly, do not post with the
    intention of provoking a reaction from fellow members. This includes encouraging flame
    wars. Instigation is not tolerated.

* __Grammar Harass__
    
    Please do not correct or insult other members grammar/spelling. Grammar harassment
    does not add to the discussion, and is not tolerated.
    
* __Use Referral/Affiliate Links__

    Linking to websites that provide you with cash or prizes in return for getting people 
    to view their page is not allowed. This includes affiliate programs.
    
* __Necro Post__

    Please do not reply to extremely old threads unless you are continuing
    substantial discussion of the topic. Contentless bumps which add very
    little to the discussion will be removed.
    
* __Post Provocative/Offensive Material__

    Provocative and/or offensive material of a sexual, violent or otherwise
    inappropriate nature is strictly not allowed. Please consider the types of
    content posted to a family friendly forum. Always ensure your content is both
    "Safe For Work" and suitable for children.
    
* __Impersonate Staff__
     
    Do not impersonate staff, this includes the use of fake banners and titles.
    

### Alternate Accounts

Members are permitted to use alt accounts under the following conditions:
    
* Alt accounts must not break *any* of the forum rules.
* Alt accounts must not be used to evade bans or posting suspensions.
* Under no circumstance is an alternate account permitted to communicate or interact 
    with any other account held by the owner(s). This includes, but is not limited 
    to:

    * Quoting posts

* You may not use alt accounts to post fake information. This includes but is not limited to:

**Examples of the correct usage of an alt account:**

* Creating a shared account for your clan/server/mod/host/project.
* Creating an alt account to use as a separate identity to your main.

### Illegal Activity

* __Piracy__

    Distribution of any content not owned by the member is unacceptable, this 
    includes all forms of media piracy (music, film, video game etc). This rule
    also extends to linking to sites that primarily function as a facilitator of
    piracy.

* __Redistribution of Mojang Property__

    Minecraft and all associated assets are property of Mojang. Redistribution 
    of Mojang owned property (for example Minecraft.jar) is not allowed, all
    posts must remain inline with the 
    [Minecraft Terms Of Service](http://www.minecraft.net/terms). Linking to 
    Mojang hosted files is acceptable, eg: assets.minecraft.net.

* __Hate Speech__

    As a family friendly and all inclusive community we do not allow any form of
    discrimination, this includes -- but is not limited to -- age, race, gender,
    nationality, ethnicity, religion, sexuality and disability.

* __Spread Malicious Content__

    Viruses and malware are forbidden, any intentional distribution of either
    will result in permanent exclusion from minecraftforum.net.

## Section Specific Rules

Each section (and individual forum) may have individual rules. Sectional rules 
do not contradict the global rules however they may require your posts to be in 
made in a specific way or contain information not required in other sections.

The sectional rules are also included in this document, after reading through
the remainder of the global rules you can scroll down to find the sectional 
rules.

## Moderator Action

The following information is about what to do when you find people breaking the 
rules and what happens if you break the rules outlined above.

### Reporting A Post

Rule breaking posts should be reported by any member that comes across them. 
There is a "report" button on every post, when a post is reported the moderators 
of the site are alerted, reports automatically include the post content. 
Reports should contain an explanation of why a post is being reported.

Any content that needs moderator attention should be reported. There are no 
penalties for mis-reporting content.

### Mini Modding

Mini-modding is replying to a rule breaking post with information on the rule break. 
Some forms of mini-modding are allowed: If a member has broken a section specific rule 
(such as posting in the wrong section or not including required information) members 
are allowed to reply to the member explaining what rule has been broken and how to fix 
the issue. To be acceptable "Mini-modding" the post must meet the following requirements:

* Explains which rule the post breaks
* Explains (where necessary) how the poster can rectify the issue
* Does not make statements such as: "reported", "I've told the mods", "This will be locked now" etc.

Then the member must report the post. "Mini-modding" without reporting the post is not allowed.

"Mini-modding" type posts will be removed once a moderator has dealt with the thread/post in question.

## Infractions

When a rule is broken an infraction will be issued. There are 2 types of infractions, formal and informal. 

### Informal

An informal infraction is used to remind a member that they have broken a minor rule for the first time. Informal infractions are used as a record
of when a member has been informed. There are no infraction points issued with informals, they do not count towards the posting suspension limits.

### Formal

A formal infraction is issued when a rule has been broken and we believe continued violation of this rule should result in a posting suspension.
A formal warning can have between 1 and 10 points associated with it, the average formal warning has 1 point.

### Points

Every 30 days infractions "expire" and the current total of a member's points is reduced. When a member's total infraction points
reach 2, then posting suspensions are issued based on the points the last infraction gave.

* 1 point infractions will give a 3 day suspension
* 2 point infractions will give a 6 day suspension
* 3 point infractions will give a 9 day suspension

Suspension times may be changed at the discretion of the administration.


### Permanent Bans

Permanent bans are never automatically issued, they are reserved for members that 
we believe to be detrimental to the minecraftforum.net community. They are issued 
to members that continually break the rules and do not provide any value to the 
community.

## Disclaimer

The administrators and moderators are responsible for the smooth and efficient running of the site. The staff reserves the right to take whatever action is deemed appropriate in any given situation, regardless of whether there is a specific rule covering that situation or not. If there is a misunderstanding or dispute, then please bring the issue up politely with that staff member in private. In all matters, the decision of the administration is final.

guarantee that a private message sent to any staff member will be replied to.
