# Servers

This section is dedicated to multiplayer servers for the PC edition of Minecraft.


## Do Not

* __Sell Items And Services__

  This goes for virtual items and services as well as real-world items and services. The only exception to this rule is hosts selling Minecraft server hosting.

* __Advertise Another Server__

  Advertising a different server in an existing server topic is not allowed.

* __Advertise Other Sites__

  Advertising other sites that are not selling Minecraft server hosting is not allowed. A host must sell Minecraft servers to be allowed to advertise in the [Minecraft Server Hosting](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forum/131-minecraft-server-hosting/) and [Other Hosts](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forum/46-other-hosts/) sections.

* __Reserve Posts__

  There is no reserving of posts or any "First!" posts. The OP should be used for this instead. These posts are considered spam and a waste of space.

* __Use Affiliate Links__

  Using affiliate or referral links is not allowed in any section.

* __Post Multiple Topics__

  There is only allowed to be 1 topic for each server or idea.

* __Post "Grief This Server" Topics__

  This also includes looking for members to help you grief or recruiting for griefing teams.

* __Blacklists__

  Blacklist and "ban this player" posts/topics are not allowed as they have been used to hurt people before. This also includes "do not go on this server" topics.

* __Copy Paste Posts__

  This is considered spam and is not allowed in any section, even if the post is relevant to the topic.

* __Use ASCII Blocks__

  Black ASCII blocks are not allowed in your topic title.

* __Start or Participate in Drama or Attacks on Users and/or Topics__

  Posting with the intent of starting drama or to maliciously attack users and/or topics is not allowed.


## PC Servers

* Cracked and offline servers are not allowed
* Stealing or copying another server's original post is not allowed, this is considered plagiarism
* Servers may be removed or banned at the staff's discretion
* Servers are to be posted in the section that best fits what the server offers, a description of the sections can be found [here](#servers:server-types)

* __Hub Servers__

  Hub servers are servers that offer multiple "servers" by connecting to one IP. These servers can only have 1 topic for the entire server. Some servers may have multiple topics only if the worlds are also reachable without connecting to the hub and are advertised as such.

* __Bumping__

  Bumping is not tolerated. Bumping is defined as making a post which is only serving to push the topic to the front page without providing any contribution to the topic. Such posts generally provide little to no discussion or do not provide content to which a reader could join. Any user or topic found to be excessively bumping or promoting it will be removed. Bumping includes, but is not limited to:
  - Posts which do not contribute or add to the topic
  - Posts which provide or encourage posting for repeatable in-game rewards
  - Posting about general Minecraft or other topics which are not directly related to the server
  - General chatter
  - Posting multiple reviews
  - Ban "reports" (i.e. "I banned x")

  Posts which are allowed include:
  - Updates about the server; those posts must include what was updated and must be limited to once every few days
  - Application for entry or a rank to play on the server
  - Discussing server related topics such as events, suggestions, and support
  - Ban appeals
