# Servers

Servers is the section for PC specific posts to be made. 

## Section-wide Rules

### Do Not


* __Sell Items And Services__
    
    This goes for virtual items as well as real-world items. The only exception to this rule is hosts selling Minecraft server hosting.
    
* __Advertise Other Sites__
    
    Advertising other sites that are not selling Minecraft server hosting is not allowed. A host must sell Minecraft servers to be allowed to advertise in the Minecraft Hosting Section
    
* __Reserve Posts__

  There is no reserving of posts or any "First!" posts. The OP should be used for this instead. These posts are considered spam and a waste of space.
  
* __Use Affiliate Links__

  Using affiliate links is not allowed in the hosting section.
  
* __Advertise Another Server__

  Advertising a different server in an existing server topic is not allowed.
  
* __Post Multiple Topics__

  There is only allowed to be 1 topic for each server or idea. There is also a posting limit of one topic every 10 days, 30 days in Hosting, this applies to all but Server Administration and Custom Server Software
  
* __Post "Grief This Server" Topics__ 

  This also includes looking for members to help you grief or recruiting for griefing teams.
  
* __Blacklists__

  Blacklist and "ban this player" posts/topics are not allowed as they have been used to hurt people before.
  
* __Copy Paste Posts__

  This is considered spam.

  Black ASCII blocks are not allowed in your topic title.

All posts that violate these rules will be removed.
