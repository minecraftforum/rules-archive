# Minecraft Support

* __Threads can be "Bumped" every 12 hours if no one responds__

    This is allowed in this section because users actually need a response in this section.

* __Do not request support for cracked servers and/or cracked clients__

    We do not support the use of cracked clients or cracked servers, and therefore will not allow people to request technical support for a cracked client/server.

* __Do not participate in OS/Platform/Browser wars__

    No one operating system, Platform, or browser was meant to run minecraft, and making topics or posts supporting a single os/Platform/browser will just degrade into flaming and trolling.
    
* __Do not Redistribute property of Mojang__

    Do not distribute any property of Mojang to other members on the forum. This includes: the minecraft launcher, the minecraft Jar, and the Minecraft server client.

* __Do not give out or request personal information__

    Personal information includes: Your location, your birthday, your transaction id, and credit card details. This information can be used to steal your Minecraft/Mojang account, and should not be given out under any circumstances.

* __Do not request help on Topics that do not relate to your issue__

    If you cannot find a topic that relates to your issue, then make a new topic about your issue. Posting on random support threads will just make it harder for other people to get support.
    
* __Do not post forum support questions in this section__

    Forum support questions belong in the Forum Discussion & Information section


## Minecraft Game Client Support

This section is for requesting support with an unmodifed client.

* __Do not ask for help with redstone__

    Redstone questions should be asked in the Redstone section of Minecraft General.

## Mojang Accounts / Minecraft.net Support
